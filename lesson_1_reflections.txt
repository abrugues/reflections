Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the
bug that was introduced?
A: The use of diff did the task more efficient, as it shows you only the 
differences between the two versions of the file.

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make
you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A: Having access to the history we can track changes in files. This
means that in the case of having a bug in our code we can go to
previous working version. Moreover, if we want to test something and
we introduced many changes, we can undo the changes if the new code is
not working.

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when
to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions
automatically saved, like Google docs does?
A: The pros and cons depends on the type of work you are doing. If you
write code, it would be more convinient to create a commit as in this
case you don't want to save something that may contain a bug. On the
other hand if you write a text document you might want that the
content is saved autommatically so that you don't have to do it
manually.

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow 
saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs,
treat each file separately?
A: Git is specifically designed to be used in the production of software.
In there the different files may be part of a whole application, so that 
they are related. In systems like Google Docs, each document might be 
independent.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history
of files?
A: With git log we can see the list of commits in the repository. Then, we 
can use git diff to compare the differences between two commits, usig the 
commit id.

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes
that could break something?
A: The posibility to switch the repository to a previous state with the
command git checkout, ensures that you can track changes and detect bugs. 

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using 
Git for?
A: I want to try Git to improve my programming skills, as now I can do
changes without having the fear of breaking existing working code. I also 
want to try it with LaTeX documents.
