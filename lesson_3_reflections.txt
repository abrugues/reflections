Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?
A: A reason to use a remote repository might be to collaborate with other 
people. You might also want as a backup of your work, and to have it 
accessible from eveywhere. 

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Manual pull ensures that you don't get unexpected code from someone else.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?
A: A clone is a copy of a repository that we do in our local machine. A fork
is a kind of clone that is used in GitHub, so that the clone can be shown in
the user's profile. A branch is a split of a repository, so that different 
modifications can happen in parallel along the branches.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
A: If you know that you will not have Internet access, beacause you are 
travelling for instance, you can update to the last state. Then you can
consult or merge to this last state at that particular point in time.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be 
easier, and what would be harder?
A: Without using Git or GitHub I would use other version control systems like 
svn. However, the use of GitHub has the advantage of being available for
everybody and from everywhere so that you don't have to set up a a back end 
infrastructure.

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than
directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A: In projects collaborating with a big number of people it might be better 
to work on separate branches. This way, the changes in the master branch can 
be approved by the team. On the other hand in small projects of 2-3 people 
it is fine to work directly on the master branch.
