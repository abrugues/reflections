Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?
A: A reason to use a remote repository might be to collaborate with other 
people. You might also want as a backup of your work, and to have it 
accessible from eveywhere. 

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Manual pull ensures that you don't get unexpected code from someone else.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?
A: A clone is a copy of a repository that we do in our local machine. A fork
is a kind of clone that is used in GitHub, so that the clone can be shown in
the user's profile. A branch is a split of a repository, so that different 
modifications can happen in parallel along the branches.
