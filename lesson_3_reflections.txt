Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?
A: A reason to use a remote repository might be to collaborate with other 
people. You might also want as a backup of your work, and to have it 
accessible from eveywhere. 

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Manual pull ensures that you don't get unexpected code from someone else.
