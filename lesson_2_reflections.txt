Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: When you initialize a repository, a folder .git is created with all the 
metadata needed by Git for the version control. This step is needed to be
able to track changes on files with Git.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: The staging area is a layer between the working directory and the
repository. There is where we place the files before the commit. Thus, it 
makes easier to respect the rule of one single commit per logical change.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change? 
A: We can add files one by one to the staging area, then compare with the
repository using the command 'git diff --staged' before each commit.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?
A: The use of branches can help to implement experimental features. Thus, you 
leave the master branch intact and your project is always ready to show.

Q: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
A: The diagrams shows at which point the branch was created, so that it can
help to see the features not included from the master branch.
